<p>Dear sir,<br/>with due respect, it is stated that I have a family function to attend due to which I won't be able to come to the office 
for the next four days from 04-07-2021 to 08-07-2021. I have assigned my work to my teammates for the time period when I would not be available. I am available on my phone or email if anything required. I will be resuming my work since 08-07-2021 and take care of the rest of the work. I request you to sanction me leave for the above mentioned period. I am looking for your positive response.<br/><br/></p>
